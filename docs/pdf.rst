:mod:`ipos.pdf` --- Manipulating pdf files
==========================================

When it comes to manipulating pdf files in Python, the most prominent alternatives
on the market are probably

* `pdf2image <https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image>`_
* `pypdfium2 <https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2>`_
* `PyMuPDF <https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF>`_

They all seem well maintained and documented.
