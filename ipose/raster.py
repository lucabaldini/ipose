    """Minimal wrapper around the standard opencv face recognition, see, e.g,
    https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/face-detection-python-opencv

    Internally this is creating a ``cv2.CascadeClassifier`` object based on a suitable
    model file for face recognition, and running a ``detectMultiScale`` call with
    the proper parameters. The output rectangles containing the candidate faces,
    which are returned by opencv as simple (x, y, width, height) tuples, are
    converted into :class:`Rectangle` objects, and the list of rectangle is sorted
    according to the corresponding area from the smallest to the largest to help
    with the selection process downstream.

    Note that this is producing squares (since apparently this is the way the default
    model we are using was trained) that are only big enough to cover the visible
    part of the face, and if you use this to crop a large image to the person face
    it is very likely that you will want to add some padding on the four sides,
    and especially on the top, which empirically seems to be the most overlooked
    part of the face.

    The ``min_neighbors`` parameter has an important effect on the results and
    should be set on a case-by-case basis. The cascade classifier applies a sliding
    window through the image, and initially it will capture a large number of false
    positives. This parameter specifies the number of neighboring rectangles that
    need to be identified for an object to be considered a valid detection: a value
    of 0 is idiotic, and it will likely return an enourmous number of (possibly
    overlapping) rectangles. Small values will yield comparatively more false positives.
    I would say 2 is the absolute minimum one migh consider using, and something
    around 5 is more germane to what is commonly found in tutorials online.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_path
        The path to input image file.

    scale_factor
        Parameter specifying how much the image size is reduced at each image scale
        (passed along verbatim as ``scaleFactor`` to the ``detectMultiScale`` call).

    min_neighbors
        Parameter specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should
        have to retain it (passed along verbatim as ``minNeighbors`` to the
        ``detectMultiScale`` call).

    min_size
        Minimum possible fractional object size. Objects smaller than that are ignored.
        This is converted internally to an actual size in pixels, corresponding
        to a square whose side is the geometric mean of the original width and height,
        multiplied by the parameter value.

        The bigger `reducing_gap`, the closer the result to the fair resampling.
